### About Myself:

I have finished Belarusian State University this year. So, now I'm working as IT Recruiter. It is a really interesting sphere, where you can learn something new everyday. So that, I know a little bit about IT sphere and different direction in it.
Not so long ago I was interesting in development. At first I try to learn Java, it was about 4 months. But then I understood, that frontend development is far more interesting for me, than backend, where you are working only with logic.
So, now I try to learn something new throught the different courses, video, books.
Although I love my current role, I feel I’m now ready for a new steps, and Frontend develipment really excites me.
